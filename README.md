# MiniLang Project

- MinLang is a mini Project Inspired by me during my Journey through learning the basics of Java Programming Language.
- It is a user-define programming made using Java which has the general concepts and structure as normal Programming language but it ends with OOPS as its final destination.

#Project Structure and its Purpose

Let us define the basic Project Folder Structure ,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Projects
    └── MinLang
    	├── README.md
    	├── src/
    	├── docs/
    	└── tests/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Projects:
	-> General Folder for storing Projects .
	-> Parent Folder


MinLang:
	-> Sub Folder of 'Projects'
	-> Main Directory for the current java project 
	-> Temporarily named as 'MinLang' . Yet to be renamed in future as "DxL"

[src/] 
- Source directory for storing java files .
- May contain lisyt of packages containing java files for parallel/simultaneous execution of programs.

[docs/]
- Similar to documentation 
- Includes context like features in this MinLang , Algorithm for complex programs ,  files tested recently , inference made from testing and debugging , future updates and patchnotes

[tests/]
- Directory storing/executing java files for testing purpose.
- Transfers Java files from src/ and executes them , inference are made and written into docs/ . failed files or files yet to be debugged and rerun are also stored here.

                                                                                ========================================================                                              
                                                                                ========================================================                                              


#Working Procedure
This is general procedure for working with this project.
Please Read it with Caution

Basically involves 6 major steps,

1. Clone the repository
	-> use the following  command to clone the repo : 
		~ git clone https://github.com/Dani-AX1423/java-project---MinLang.git
		~ cd java-project---MinLang 

2. Check/verify the folder structure of this clone repo
	-> using basic commands to analyze and verify if the structure is in tree format
		~ ls
		~ tree

3. Write the Java Programs in src/ directory
	-> Define the problem and write algorithm for it in docs/
	-> Implement it using java language and write program to store it in src/

4. Testing and Execution of code 
	-> Transfer or copy java files that you want to excute from src/ directory.
	-> Compile and excute them and make inference from it. Debug if it requires

5. Document changes/Updates in docs/
	-> Write the inference from programs or features that will be added in the future.
	-> Inference and feature notes should not interfer with each and should be written in separate files.

6. Commit & Push
	-> after all these steps, use commit command to set the savepoint
		~ git commit -m "<meaningful message"
	-> Push the files into repo using :
		~ git push
[Note : only valid and working java files should to be pushed]
